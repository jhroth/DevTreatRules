## Resubmission on May 12, 2019
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Replaced the OWL abbrevation in the DESCRIPTION with the full name, outcome-weighted learning.
* Re-written the description field of the DESCRIPTION file to add references for the outcome-weighted learning and direct-interactions methods. The third method in that field, split-regression, is a standard ad-hoc alternative that to my knowledge does not have a reference, so I added a brief summary of that method in place of a reference.

## Resubmission on May 9, 2019
This is a resubmission. In this version I added new imports to the NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION files so the "undefined global functions or variables:"no longer appears
