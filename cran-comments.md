## Resubmission on May 9, 2019
This is a resubmission. In this version I added new imports to the NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION files so the "undefined global functions or variables:"no longer appears


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
